# Capitol Reef

## WILD Weekend

My goal is to share as much information about each activity that I can, whether it's hiking, skiing, camping trip, etc. I'd love to be able to share my knowledge about the different places I go and what activities I do. For example, information on where I stayed, who I traveled with (if I felt safe traveling alone), what/where I ate, and the travel conditions I encountered. All that to say, I'm basically going to be writing about my experiences as I go along and share them with you so that hopefully you can be well informed before embarking on fun adventures too. I have a bucket list of places I'd love to see and adventures planned but I'd love for this platform to be a two-way mechanism for people to provide recommendations to me as well! Stay tuned for more information on that but I'm excited to make this platform as user-friendly and as engaging as possible.

## Filler Content

I know that I'm just getting started and I'm pretty early on in this journey, but I really do appreciate you tuning in and checking out the page! This is one of those kinds of things where I'm figuring it out and learning as I go so I definitely appreciate the continued support and patience. Thank you for stopping by and checking things out, it really means the world!
