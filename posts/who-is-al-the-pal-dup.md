I'm not really sure where to start so I guess I'll start from the beginning. I'm from a small town just south of Geneseo, New York where some say there are more cows than people. As far back as I could remember, I was always playing sports whether it was organized sports or it was playing in the background with friends from the neighborhood. In high school, I was a decent three-sport athlete and traveled every weekend playing at least one or two of those sports. I continued on to play softball and soccer during my freshman year of college where I met some of my lifelong friends. Even though I decided not to return to my sophomore year as a soccer player, I continued playing softball throughout my collegiate career. After graduating from Cortland, I soon found out that I no longer knew what my purpose was. I didn't have a set career path, I didn't know where I wanted to live, I was newly single and I had lost my identity of being an athlete. Needless to say, this ultimately left me lost, confused, and experiencing a serious identity crisis.

Although we had always gone camping growing up, I had never really considered myself much of a hiker or the "outdoorsy" type. I'd only really go camping if my parents had planned a trip and even then I think it would be categorized more as glamping...ya know with refrigerators, heat, and water easily accessible. Once I had moved out, I didn't really have a passion until my roommate at the time, Bella (love ya sis), told me about the Adirondack 46ers "challenge". The Adirondack 46ers isÂ a hiking organization comprised of individuals who have climbed all 46 of the traditionally recognized High Peaks of the Adirondack Mountains. To be a high peak the summit of the mountain is supposed to be above 4,000 feet, however, there are some peaks just below 4,000 feet that are counted on the list. If you're interested in becoming a 46er or want to learn more about the organization I'll be sure to link the website!
