# Welcome

Hi everyone and welcome to my brand new Adventures AF website! I told my story in my "about me" page but as a quick introduction I'm Al Flint and I'm a 27-year-old based out of Buffalo, New York. I'm a Project Manager during the work week but on the weekends I am extremely passionate about being outside. I love to do everything from skiing and snowboarding in the winter to camping and hiking in the summer. Since graduating college I've been on a journey of self growth and I've found a lot of happiness in outdoor activities. I've been "seriously" hiking for three or four years now and I've loved it so much that I decided to invest in a camera...a Fuji Film X-S10 to be exact for all you photographers out there. I'm by no means an expert in any sense of the word and I'm still trying to figure it all out but I've been having a ton of fun learning! It's definitely been a little bit of a struggle seeing as I have no experience with photography and I've been trying to google everything to figure it out but it's definitely been a welcome challenge. I'll be sure to share the photos that I take on my camera and on my phone along the way. I'm excited to start sharing with you and I hope that you find my insights helpful.

## Future Content

My goal is to share as much information about each activity that I can, whether it's hiking, skiing, camping trip, etc. I'd love to be able to share my knowledge about the different places I go and what activities I do. For example, information on where I stayed, who I traveled with (if I felt safe traveling alone), what/where I ate, and the travel conditions I encountered. All that to say, I'm basically going to be writing about my experiences as I go along and share them with you so that hopefully you can be well informed before embarking on fun adventures too. I have a bucket list of places I'd love to see and adventures planned but I'd love for this platform to be a two-way mechanism for people to provide recommendations to me as well! Stay tuned for more information on that but I'm excited to make this platform as user-friendly and as engaging as possible.

## Quick Thank You

I know that I'm just getting started and I'm pretty early on in this journey, but I really do appreciate you tuning in and checking out the page! This is one of those kinds of things where I'm figuring it out and learning as I go so I definitely appreciate the continued support and patience. Thank you for stopping by and checking things out, it really means the world!



## Happy Adventures!
